 <center><h4 class="dv">Analysis of Justification<h4><center>
   <p class="oa">The Cold War was a period of tension and ideological conflict, that happened between the United States and the Soviet Union It lasted from the end of World War 2 until the early 1990s it was characterized by very intense rivalry but a good thing it is that it did not get to a direct military confrontation. Several things contributed to the Cold War. Firstly, there was an ideological clash between the capitalist values of the United States and the communist principles of the Soviet Union. The cold was also going because of strategic and military considerations. Both of them wanted to secure their national security interests and expand their influence. A significant resolution factor of the Cold War was a shift in the leadership and the policy on both sides. The format and resolution came out with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 because of the failed political system, political unrest, and independence movements within the Soviet republics led to the disintegration of the Soviet Union and this event ended the Cold War era. My humble opinion is that this was not justified because they should fight over territory or government when they have enough. I know that they had economic problems and they needed that but still is not a justification for a war.<p>
